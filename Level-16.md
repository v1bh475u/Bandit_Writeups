Here, we need to connect to localhost via ssl encryption.<br>
We do that using `openssl s_client`.<br>
`openssl` allows us to use ssl for connecting and `s_client` allows us to act as clients (the person accessing the machine for services.)<br>
Since we want to connect to localhost:30001, we will use `openssl s_client localhost:30001`.<br>
