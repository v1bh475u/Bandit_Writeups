We need to find a file with following qualities:<br>
-human readable<br>
-1033 bytes in size<br>
-not executable<br>
We will use `find` command for this level.<br>
For human readable, we will use `-readable` flag.<br>
For size, we will use `-size 1033c` (as suffix c denotes size written in bytes.)<br>
For not executable, we will use `-type f ! -executable`.<br>
